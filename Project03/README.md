        start button, all blocks are at the right places. Once the button is clicked, blolcks will be mixed and the player is
        able to play the game.

        In order to move blocks, please use the mouse to click the block you want to move (one with a number on it), and that
        number will be shown at the upper right corner after words "Selected Block:". Then, click the blank block, and the two
        blocks will be swapped.

	c. Tracking
        Everytime a swapping action happens, the number of moves grows bigger by one.
        When all blocks are at the right position, the player wins, and a winning message wil be shown at the lower left corner

	game.
